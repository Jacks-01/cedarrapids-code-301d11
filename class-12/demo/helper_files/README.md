# Class 11 Demo Helper Files

These two files demonstrate how to populate and clear the demo database. You can use them as guides when initializing or clearing your project databases.

- Put the files into the same folder as your server.js
- Execute from the command line using node followed by the name of the file

To initialize (seed) the database:

```bash
node seed.js
```

To empty (clear) the database:

```bash
node clear.js
```
