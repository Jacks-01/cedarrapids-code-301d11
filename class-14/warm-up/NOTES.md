## Overview of today's warm-up challenge

This sample is written in Java. It is a game where the user has to guess where the tree is located in a forest. It includes several helper functions to evaluate how close the player is to the tree. 


NOTE: To run this it would need to import java.util.Scanner and you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK).

Compile from the command line with 
```bash
javac -d ./ Locate.java
```

Run the resultant .class file with 
```bash
java Locate
```
